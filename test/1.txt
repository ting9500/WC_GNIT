Spring is the best season of the year. The weather gets warmer and warmer. My classmates and I took a one-day sightseeing around our city. The scene was pretty. But when we saw the rivers along our city, I felt very sorry, and thought a lot. 
With the development of modern agriculture and industry, more and more waste water is being poured into rivers. It has caused serious pollution. The river is becoming so dirty that no living things can live in it. The river is giving off a terrible smell. 
        
      
We make an urgent appeal that measures should be taken to cope with the situation. Our government should start building various facilities such as sewage treatment! plant and encourage scientists to work out more and better ways to reduce the pollution of water. 
Water is tho source of our lives. It is very important to protect water.
